Note: the reported 17Δ does not exactly agree with δ17O and δ18O because of corrections were applied directly to 17Δ and were separately applied to δ17O and δ18O. If 17Δ value is necessary, it is better to use this value than to calculate 17Δ from δ17O and δ18O. If δ17O and δ18O need to be used, it may be preferable to use 17Δ and δ17O and recalculate δ18O since the corrections are more uncertain for δ18O than for the other isotopic quantities.
